Week 3 

The app now supports intuitive gesture functionality, allowing users to swipe from the left edge to open or close the drawer and tap items like playlists for navigation. Smooth transition effects enhance user experience with a fade animation for the Sign-Up screen and a slide transition for Settings, powered by React Native Reanimated. Nvigation persistence is implemented using AsyncStorage, saving the last visited screen and restoring it on app launch to represent the user's login staying persistent.

Week 4 - ACtivity 1

The playlist builder demonstrates advanced state management using useReducer to handle complex song list operations including add, remove, clear, and history tracking. Undo and redo functionality was implemented by maintaining a state history stack, allowing users to reverse playlist modifications seamlessly. React-native-reanimated provides fade and slide animations for list updates, creating smooth visual transitions when songs are added or removed. The playlist state and action history are persisted using AsyncStorage, ensuring data survives app restarts, while performance is optimized through React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the song list component.
